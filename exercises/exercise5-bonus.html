            About me
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a Senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst pursuing degrees in Communication and Digital design with a minor in Psychology. I have a passion for visual communication and savvy design and am looking to begin my career shortly after I graduate in May of 2026.

        <p>
            After completing my undergraduate degree I am looking to work within visual communication. My time at University has given me experience with Adobe Creative Suits, Canva, Microsoft, HTML, Python, along with verbal and written communication. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In my portfolio I seek to highlight the skills I have learned both in school and on my own. I showcase my troubleshooting, technical, and creative skills. During my time in school I have taken classes and opportunities that have allowed me to strengthen these skills. In creating my own major of Digital Design, I have been able to take art and design principle courses. These courses have been integral to my development of core design skills for which I have continued work on outside of the classroom.
