        I grew up with a house full of baked goods. My mom started a baking company when I was about six years old, so I naturally became her in-house pastry tester. As an avid cookie enthusiast with a credible palate, here is my go-to oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe;

        Ingredients
    </h2>

        <li>
            8 tablespoons of unsalted butter, at room temperature
        </li>

        <li>
            1/2 cup gluten free quick cook oats
        </li>

        <li>
            1 cup <a href="https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/gluten-free-all-purpose-flour?_gl=1*15t5cw1*_gcl_au*MTczNDYzODU4Ny4xNzcxODEyOTIw*_ga*MTkzMzI1NzkxOS4xNzcxODEyOTIw*_ga_1ZJWCQGS21*czE3NzE4MTI5MTkkbzEkZzEkdDE3NzE4MTMxNzckajYwJGwwJGgw">gluten free all-purpose flour</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          1/2 cup brown sugar
        </li>

        <li>
            1/4 cup granulated sugar
        </li>

        <li>
            1/2 teaspoon Salt    
        </li>

        <li>
            1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
        </li>

        <li>
            1 large egg
        </li>

        <li>
           1 1/2 cups <a href="https://thrivemarket.com/p/enjoy-life-semi-sweet-chocolate-mini-chips?utm_source=google&utm_medium=pla&region_id=15">Enjoy Life</a> Gluten free choloate chips
        </li>
    </ul>


    
    



    <h3>
        Step 1
    </h3>
    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line several cookie sheets with parchment paper, or lightly grease with non-stick vegetable oil spray.
    </p>


    <h3>
        Step 2
    </h3>

    <p>
        Beat together the butter and sugars until smooth.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Step 3
    </h3>
<p>
        Add the egg and vanilla, beating to combine.

</p>


    <h3>
        Step 4
    </h3>

    <p>
        Whisk together the flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt, and add to the butter mixture in the bowl.
    </p>


    <h3>
        Step 5
    </h3>

    <p>
        Mix until everything is thoroughly incorporated. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, and mix briefly.
    </p>


    <h3>
        Step 6
    </h3>

    <p>
        Stir in the chocolate chips.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Step 7
    </h3>

    <p>
        Scoop the dough by the teaspoonful onto the prepared baking sheets; a teaspoon cookie scoop works well here. Leave about 1 1/2" between cookies.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Step 8
    </h3>

    <p>
        Bake the cookies for 13 to 14 minutes, until they're a light golden brown, with slightly darker edges. Their middles may still look a tiny bit shiny; that's OK, they'll continue to bake as they cool on the pan.
    </p>


    <h3>
      Step 9  
    </h3>

    <p>
        Remove the cookies from the oven, and as soon as they're set enough to handle, transfer them to racks to cool.
    </p>
